Battery Management System (BMS) plays a crucial role in monitoring and maintaining the performance and health of the batteries, particularly in electric vehicles and energy storage applications. Accurate prediction of SoH (State of Health) and SoC (State of Charge) is essential for sustainable approach. Semi-empirical models, which combine physical principles with empirical data, are highly effective for such estimations but present significant challenges in terms of stability, real-time deployment, and continuous feedback. While Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has matured for ML models, there is no equivalent framework for managing, deploying and scaling semi-empirical models. Conventional SoH semi-empirical models, while grounded in electro-chemical principles, exhibit limited adaptability due to their reliance on fixed parameterization, inability to generalize across varying operating conditions, and lacks scalability. These models often deviate from the test-bench SoH measurements, leading to sub-optimal SoH predictions in real-world applications. 

This research develops a Numerical Model Operations (NMOps) architecture follows a MLOps architecture, enabling management, deployment and scaling of semi-empirical models, or otherwise any numerical hybrid models. Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) is employed as the core algorithm in this architecture to compute an optimal correction factor that aligns semi-empirical SOH estimates with laboratory derived test-bench SOH under equivalent degradation conditions. The MHE correction factor is optimized using a regularized least-squares minimization approach over a finite horizon, ensuring smooth and stable parameter adjustments. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is subsequently applied to refine the corrected SOH estimates by reducing transient fluctuations and measurement noise, ensuring robust time-series consistency.

Validation is conducted through statistical metrics such as Root Mean Sqaure Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE),and Pearson Correlation Coefficient, ensuring that SOH estimates exhibit high fidelity to test bench ground truth data. ("results and conclusion to be updated").
