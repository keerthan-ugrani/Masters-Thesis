This chapter usually represents the main body of the work. Before the first section, a brief overview (a few sentences with references to subsequent sections) should be provided. Example: In the following section \ref{sec:overview}, an overview of the model's requirements is provided. 

\section{Overview and Objectives}
\label{sec:overview} 

Just under two pages, providing an overview of the requirements, objectives, and methods. Here, the description should be more technical or formal than in the introduction, as the reader is now familiar with the fundamentals and related work.

\section{Erster Teil}
\label{sec:teil1}

In this and the following sections, the contributions of the work are described in a motivated and formally sound manner (often mathematically, i.e., with definitions, etc.), and, where necessary, illustrated with examples. The descriptions in this chapter are mostly independent of any concrete implementation and data; these are detailed in the following chapter.

\section{Zweiter Teil}
