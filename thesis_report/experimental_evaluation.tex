The structure of this chapter, or its division into two chapters, depends heavily on the topic and the way it is addressed. It describes the data used for an evaluation (sources, examples, statistics), the objective of the evaluation, the metrics used, and the results (including charts, diagrams, figures, etc.).

This chapter can also begin with a description of the implementation of a system (no source code, at most class diagrams!).
