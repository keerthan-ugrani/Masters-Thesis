ABSTRACT = {Electric vehicles are set to be the dominant form of transportation in the near future and Lithium-based rechargeable battery packs have been widely adopted in them. Battery packs need to be constantly monitored and managed in order to maintain the safety, efficiency and reliability of the overall electric vehicle system. A battery management system consists of a battery fuel gauge, optimal charging algorithm, and cell/thermal balancing circuitry. It uses three non-invasive measurements from the battery, voltage, current and temperature, in order to estimate crucial states and parameters of the battery system, such as battery impedance, battery capacity, state of charge, state of health, power fade, and remaining useful life. These estimates are important for the proper functioning of optimal charging algorithms, charge and thermal balancing strategies, and battery safety mechanisms. Approach to robust battery management consists of accurate characterization, robust estimation of battery states and parameters, and optimal battery control strategies. This paper describes some recent approaches developed by the authors towards developing a robust battery management system.},

ABSTRACT = {Lithium-ion power batteries have been widely used in transportation due to their advantages of long life, high specific power, and energy. However, the safety problems caused by the inaccurate estimation and prediction of battery health state have attracted wide attention in academic circles. In this paper, the degradation mechanism and main definitions of state of health (SOH) were described by summarizing domestic and foreign literatures. The estimation and prediction methods of lithium-ion power battery SOH were discussed from three aspects: model-based methods, data-driven methods, and fusion technology methods. This review summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the current mainstream SOH estimation and prediction methods. This paper believes that more innovative feature parameter extraction methods, multi-algorithm coupling, combined with cloud platform and other technologies will be the development trend of SOH estimation and prediction in the future, which provides a reference for health state estimation and prediction of lithium-ion power battery.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy shortage and environmental pollution issues can be reduced considerably with the development and usage of electric vehicles (EVs). However, electric vehicle performance and battery lifespan depend on a suitable battery arrangement to meet the various battery performance demands. The safety, reliability, and efficiency of EVs largely depends on the constant monitoring of the batteries and management of battery packs. This work comprehensively reviews different aspects of battery management systems (BMS), i.e., architecture, functions, requirements, topologies, fundamentals of battery modeling, different battery models, issues/challenges, recommendations, and active and passive cell balancing approaches, etc., as compared to the existing works which normally discuss one or two aspects only. The work describes BMS functions, battery models and their comparisons in detail for an efficient operation of the battery pack. Similarly, the work presents a comprehensive overview of issues and challenges faced by BMS and also provides recommendations to address these challenges. Cell balancing is very important for the battery performance and in this work various cell balancing methodologies and their comparisons are also presented in detail. Modeling of a cell balancer is presented and a comparative study is also carried out for active and passive cell balance technique in MATLAB/Simulink with an eight cell battery packcell balancing approach. The result shows that the active cell balancing technique is more advantageous than passive balancing for electrical vehicles using lithium-ion batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the lithium battery degradation mechanisms and failure modes. It discusses these issues in a general context and then focuses on various families or material types used in the batteries, particularly in anodes and cathodes. The paper begins with a general overview of lithium batteries and their operations. It explains the fundamental principles of the electrochemical reaction that occurs in a battery, as well as the key components such as the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. The paper explores also the degradation processes and failure modes of lithium batteries. It examines the main factors contributing to these issues, including the operating temperature and current. It highlights the specific degradation mechanisms associated with each type of material, whether it is graphite, silicon, metallic lithium, cobalt, nickel, or manganese oxides used in the electrodes. Some degradations are due to the temperature and the current waveforms. Then, the importance of thermal management and current management is emphasized throughout the paper. It highlights the negative effects of overheating, excessive current, or inappropriate voltage on the stability and lifespan of lithium batteries. It also underscores the significance of battery management systems (BMS) in monitoring and controlling these parameters to minimize the degradation and the risk of failure. This work provides a summary of valuable insight into the development of BMS. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the degradation mechanisms and failure modes specific to different families of lithium batteries, as well as the critical influence of temperature and current quality. Rational management or efficient controlling of these parameters can enhance the performance, reliability, and lifespan of lithium batteries.},

ABSTRACT = {The state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) are two crucial indicators needed for a proper and safe operation of the battery. Coulomb counting is one of the most adopted and straightforward methods to calculate the SOC. Although it can be implemented for all kinds of applications, its accuracy is strongly dependent on the operation conditions. In this work, the behavior of the batteries at different current and temperature conditions is analyzed in order to adjust the charge measurement according to the battery efficiency at the specific operating conditions. The open-circuit voltage (OCV) is used to reset the SOC estimation and prevent the error accumulation. Furthermore, the SOH is estimated by evaluating the accumulated charge between two different SOC using a recursive least squares (RLS) method. The SOC and SOH estimations are verified through an extensive test in which the battery is subjected to a dynamic load profile at different temperatures.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurately estimating the state of health (SOH) of a lithium-ion battery is significant for electronic devices. To solve the nonlinear degradation problem of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) caused by capacity regeneration, this paper proposes a new LIB degradation model and improved particle filter algorithm for LIB SOH estimation. Firstly, the degradation process of LIB is divided into the normal degradation stage and the capacity regeneration stage. A multi-stage prediction model (MPM) based on the calendar time of the LIB is proposed. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm is embedded into the standard particle filter to increase the diversity of particles and improve prediction accuracy. Finally, the method is verified with the LIB dataset provided by the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy of capacity prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {Battery management systems (BMSs) play a critical role in electric vehicles (EVs), relying heavily on two essential factors: the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH). However, accurately estimating the SOC and SOH in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries remains a challenge. To address this, many researchers have turned to machine learning (ML) techniques. This study provides a comprehensive overview of both BMSs and ML, reviewing the latest research on popular ML methods for estimating the SOC and SOH. Additionally, it highlights the challenges involved. Beyond traditional models like equivalent circuit models (ECMs) and electrochemical battery models, this review emphasizes the prevalence of a support vector machine (SVM), fuzzy logic (FL), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), and transfer learning in SOC and SOH estimation.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper provides an overview of nonlinear state estimation techniques along with a discussion on the challenges and opportunities for future work in the field. Emphasis is given on Bayesian methods such as moving horizon estimation (MHE) and extended Kalman filter (EKF). A discussion on Bayesian, deterministic, and hybrid methods is provided and examples of each of these methods are listed. An approach for nonlinear state estimation design is included to guide the selection of the nonlinear estimator by the user/practitioner. Some of the current challenges in the field are discussed involving covariance estimation, uncertainty quantification, time-scale multiplicity, bioprocess monitoring, and online implementation. A case study in which MHE and EKF are applied to a batch reactor system is addressed to highlight the challenges of these technologies in terms of performance and computational time. This case study is followed by some possible opportunities for state estimation in the future including the incorporation of more efficient optimization techniques and development of heuristics to streamline the further adoption of MHE.},

ABSTRACT = {An accurate and reliable positioning system (PS) is a significant topic of research due to its broad range of aerospace applications, such as the localization of autonomous agents in GPS-denied and indoor environments. The PS discussed in this work uses ultra-wide band (UWB) sensors to provide distance measurements. UWB sensors are based on radio frequency technology and offer low power consumption, wide bandwidth, and precise ranging in the presence of nominal environmental noise. However, in practical situations, UWB sensors experience varying measurement noise due to unexpected obstacles in the environment. The localization accuracy is highly dependent on the filtering of such noise, and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is one of the widely used techniques. In varying noise situations, where the obstacles generate larger measurement noise than nominal levels, EKF cannot offer precise results. Therefore, this work proposes two approaches based on EKF: sequential adaptive EKF and piecewise adaptive EKF. Simulation studies are conducted in static, linear, and nonlinear scenarios, and it is observed that higher accuracy is achieved by applying the proposed approaches as compared to the traditional EKF method.},

ABSTRACT = {Engineering systems experiencing high-rate dynamic events, including airbags, debris detection, and active blast protection systems, could benefit from real-time observability for enhanced performance. However, the task of high-rate state estimation is challenging, in particular for real-time applications where the rate of the observer’s convergence needs to be in the microsecond range. This paper identifies the challenges of state estimation of high-rate systems and discusses the fundamental characteristics of high-rate systems. A survey of applications and methods for estimators that have the potential to produce accurate estimations for a complex system experiencing highly dynamic events is presented. It is argued that adaptive observers are important to this research. In particular, adaptive data-driven observers are advantageous due to their adaptability and lack of dependence on the system model.},

A specially modified Monte Carlo localization method is used for extracting the local features as the virtual poles [4, 5].

ABSTRACT = {State estimation is widely used in various automated systems, including IoT systems, unmanned systems, robots, etc. In traditional state estimation, measurement data are instantaneous and processed in real time. With modern systems’ development, sensors can obtain more and more signals and store them. Therefore, how to use these measurement big data to improve the performance of state estimation has become a hot research issue in this field. This paper reviews the development of state estimation and future development trends. First, we review the model-based state estimation methods, including the Kalman filter, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc. Particle filters and Gaussian mixture filters that can handle mixed Gaussian noise are discussed, too. These methods have high requirements for models, while it is not easy to obtain accurate system models in practice. The emergence of robust filters, the interacting multiple model (IMM), and adaptive filters are also mentioned here. Secondly, the current research status of data-driven state estimation methods is introduced based on network learning. Finally, the main research results for hybrid filters obtained in recent years are summarized and discussed, which combine model-based methods and data-driven methods. This paper is based on state estimation research results and provides a more detailed overview of model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid-driven approaches. The main algorithm of each method is provided so that beginners can have a clearer understanding. Additionally, it discusses the future development trends for researchers in state estimation.},

These articles were carefully analyzed to summarize research trends, model selection, and estimation methods. Research trends cover publication years, journals, keywords. In terms of model selection, the review examines scalability, programming languages & software, battery materials, the choice of models, model simplification techniques, and parameter identification processes. The estimation methods are assessed based on the specific battery states and the algorithms employed for state estimation. The results indicate that while research in this area has been growing, it primarily focuses on individual cells, with limited attention paid to battery modules and packs. There is a noticeable lack of standardization in model simplification and parameter identification processes. Most studies concentrate on a single state estimation, with state of charge being mostly investigated, followed by state of health and state of temperature. Future research should address state estimation for modules and packs, parameter identification, model simplification, joint multi-state estimation, and better utilization of internal battery information for improving battery performance and safety.}

ABSTRACT = {This paper considers the estimation of SOC and SOH for lithium batteries using multi-innovation Levenberg–Marquardt and adaptive weighting unscented Kalman filter algorithms. For parameter identification, the second-order derivative of the objective function to optimize the traditional gradient descent algorithm is used. For SOC estimation, an adaptive weighting unscented Kalman filter algorithm is proposed to deal with the nonlinear update problem of the mean and covariance, which can substantially improve the estimation accuracy of the internal state of the lithium battery. Compared with fixed weights in the traditional unscented Kalman filtering algorithm, this algorithm adaptively adjusts the weights according to the state and measured values to improve the state estimation update accuracy. Finally, according to simulations, the errors of this algorithm are all lower than 1.63 %, which confirms the effectiveness of this algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {The battery state of charge (SoC), whose estimation is one of the basic functions of battery management system (BMS), is a vital input parameter in the energy management and power distribution control of electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, two methods based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF), respectively, are proposed to estimate the SoC of a lithium-ion battery used in EVs. The lithium-ion battery is modeled with the Thevenin model and the model parameters are identified based on experimental data and validated with the Beijing Driving Cycle. Then space equations used for SoC estimation are established. The SoC estimation results with EKF and UKF are compared in aspects of accuracy and convergence. It is concluded that the two algorithms both perform well, while the UKF algorithm is much better with a faster convergence ability and a higher accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {A brushless parallel hybrid excitation claw pole generator (HECPG) is proposed for electric vehicle (EV) application. Permanent magnet (PM) excitation method can reduce the volume of the machine and improve the power density and efficiency. Moreover, the voltage regulation can be ensured by field excitation. The flux path of the proposed HECPG is complex, and it will take a long time for 3D finite element analysis (FEA) to process it. To reduce simulation time, the mathematical model of the generator is given by a mesh-based 3D magnet equivalent circuit (MEC) network method considering radial and axial flux, magnetic saturation, and magnetic flux leakage. The performance of the generator is analyzed by FEA and prototype experiment. Finally, the results of 3D MEC, FEA, and experiment are compared. There is little difference between the three results, so 3D MEC can ensure the accuracy and significantly reduce the simulation time. The efficiency of the proposed HECPG is 90%, and the DC-Bus voltage can be modulated by changing the amplitude of field current.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy storage plays an important role in the adoption of renewable energy to help solve climate change problems. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are an excellent solution for energy storage due to their properties. In order to ensure the safety and efficient operation of LIB systems, battery management systems (BMSs) are required. The current design and functionality of BMSs suffer from a few critical drawbacks including low computational capability and limited data storage. Recently, there has been some effort in researching and developing smart BMSs utilizing the cloud platform. A cloud-based BMS would be able to solve the problems of computational capability and data storage in the current BMSs. It would also lead to more accurate and reliable battery algorithms and allow the development of other complex BMS functions. This study reviews the concept and design of cloud-based smart BMSs and provides some perspectives on their functionality and usability as well as their benefits for future battery applications. The potential division between the local and cloud functions of smart BMSs is also discussed. Cloud-based smart BMSs are expected to improve the reliability and overall performance of LIB systems, contributing to the mass adoption of renewable energy.},
